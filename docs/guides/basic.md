  Defining a single service and resource with the Terraform Clarity Provider.
---

# Setup

Minimal definition to import the `clarity` provider.

```terraform
terraform {
  required_version = ">=0.13"

  required_providers {
    clarity = {
      source = "clarity-st/clarity"
      version = "0.0.0"
    }
  }
}

provider "clarity" {}
```

# Service

-> Providers are currently not supported in the terraform provider.

```terraform
resource "clarity_service" "api" {
  provider_slug = "artifact"
  name          = "My API"
}
```

# Resource

```terraform
resource "clarity_resource" "dev" {
  provider_slug = "development"
  service_slug  = clarity_service.api.slug
  name          = "dev"

  lambda {
    function_name = "api"
  }
}
```
